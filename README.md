* Some local taxi associations want to streamline the queues
    at local taxi ranks. They want to create an app that shows/organizes queues. 
    They are starting at one rank.
* They would like to show the number of people queueing for each route. 
    Once a given number of people is in the queue and a taxi is in the queue 
    the taxi leaves and the number of people in the queue goes down, a taxi canâ€™t leave 
    if there are not enough people in the queue. The app should have the 
    ability to increment or decrement the number of people in a queue.

## Extra-Functionality
* Keep count of the number of taxis leaving each queue.
* Keep count of the total taxi fare for each trip and overall total for the day.
* Ensure that your app is responsive and does not add duplicates and negative values.
* Store data in localStorage so that data is retained after a screen refresh.
* Add the ability to add more destinations.
* What would if take to add more Taxi ranks?
